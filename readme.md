# Train Navigator

This is a full-stack web application to show some (made up) train connections.

The main purpose of this project is to practice and showcase my web dev skills.

### Tech Stack

This app is build with a react frontend using vitejs and a backend using nodejs and express.

## Run Frontend

```
npm run dev
```

Open browser and type: http://localhost:3000

## Run Backend

Make sure you have NodeJS installed.

```
    cd server
    node .
```

To inspect backend, open browser and type: http://localhost:8080
or something like
http://localhost:8080?q=bear

## Setup

The frontend was setup with vite by typing:

```
 npm init vite train-navigator
 npm install
```

The backend was setup to use express (and nodejs).

```
    cd server
    npm init -y
    npm install express
```
